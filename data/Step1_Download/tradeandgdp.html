Latest actual data: 2013
Notes: Belarus purchases crude oil from Russia at a price different from the world market price: they get it at a substantial discount. The dynamics of the imported oil price deflator is set by world prices as well as by the subsidy, so it does not follow world prices. Deflator of oil exports reflects (i) crude oil and (ii) oil products. Oil products are priced differently from crude oil. The historical values are taken from the authorities’ data. Projections should be reasonably close to WEO’s numbers because we use POILAPSP for “pricing” oil products in the projection period.

Trade System: The Free Zones are included as part of Chile´s economic territory. This means that customs declarations, which are compiled according to the Special Trade System, are adjusted, so that goods are registered as imports when they enter the Free Zones. Re-exports from the Free Zones are recorded as exports.
Excluded items in trade: (According to BPM5, goods in direct transit are excluded. )
Valuation of exports: Free on board (FOB). customs value of some big-scale exports is adjusted to better reflect market prices. Estimates of prices are made to adjust preliminary customs export data on goods sold on consignment or by other mechanisms according to which definite values are unknown at the time of shipment.

Latest actual data: 2013
Base year: 2005
Methodology used to derive volumes: Deflation by unit value indexes (from customs data)
Formula used to derive volumes: Fisher. Export and import price indices were calculated according to the Fisher’s, so-called ideal, formula, which is a geometrical mean between the Laspeyres’ and Paasche’s formulae.
Chain-weighted: No. Export and import price indices are calculated as monthly or quarterly as compared to the base year (previous year). For example, export and import price indices for the first quarter of 2011 are calculated as compared to the period from January to December 2010.
Trade System: Special trade. Special – special trade in a wider sense: processing in customs warehouses and free zones are included.
Excluded items in trade: In transit;Low valued;Re-exports;Re-imports;. According to the recommendations of the United Nations and EU, the following transactions with goods are excluded: means of payment that are legal tender, monetary gold, temporarily received or dispatched goods, transit goods, goods intended for diplomatic use, goods in operative leasing, temporary exports and import, personal effects of passengers and tourists, and commercial samples and postal parcels of low value.
Oil coverage: Primary or unrefined products;Secondary or refined products;Other;
Valuation of exports: Free on board (FOB)
Valuation of imports: Cost, insurance, freight (CIF)

Latest actual data: 2013
Notes: Oil trade includes other energy trade such as fuel. Therefore, the price of oil imports and oil exports will differ from the WEO assumption since it includes the price of other energy items such as gas, etc. The weights are about 70 percent oil and 30 percent gas for 2011.
Base year: 2005
Methodology used to derive volumes: Deflation by unit value indexes (from customs data)
Formula used to derive volumes: Fisher. Trade volumes are the ratio of the value index to the Fisher unit value index (chain-weighted). The value indices are obtained as the ratio of current values to the arithmetic average of the base year values. Foreign trade indices have been calculated by Eurostat and U.N. concepts and methods.
Chain-weighted: Yes, from 2003. Unit value indices are chain-weighted, but volume indices are not.
Trade System: Special trade. Relaxed definition. Foreign trade statistics include goods which enter/leave the statistical territory of Turkey from/to other countries and are placed under the customs normal export and import procedures and under customs inward and outward processing procedures.
Excluded items in trade: In transit;Low valued;Other;. Excluded items include goods valued under $100, transit trade, temporary export/import trade, repair and maintenance of goods, operational leasing, shuttle trade, border trade, some transactions with declaration that are not goods (cash, valuable paper, stamps, monetary gold, etc.). Other exclusions include border and coastal trade. Customs warehouses, free zones, and duty-free shops in Turkey are considered beyond the customs frontier. Note that while Turkstat and the Central Bank of Turkey make estimates on shuttle trade for BOP data, these are not included in the foreign trade statistics disseminated by Turkstat.
Oil coverage: Primary or unrefined products;Secondary or refined products;Other;. All items covered.
Valuation of exports: Free on board (FOB)
Valuation of imports: Cost, insurance, freight (CIF)
